i've been practicing colemak for a week or two now and here's where I am right now.
I kinda like this new layout over my old one. The keys are closer towards the home row,
and while typing is slower because I'm not used to this layout, it's more comfortable
on my fingers.

Would totally recommend :). The only thing I dislike is the position of the semicolon
(which I use quite a bit because of C++)
