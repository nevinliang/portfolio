For the past few years that I've had a blog/portfolio/website, I've always only
ever used static-site html and deployed on Github pages. But, as I'm starting
full stack work soon, I thought I'd try my hand at something new so here it is.
New blog written in TypeScript using Next.js framework and deployed with Vercel.
