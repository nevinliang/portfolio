I've been sticking with Colemak for about 3 months now and after turning to this
layout cold turkey, it's definitely more comfortable than qwerty now. I have to
admit it is pretty difficult increasing typing speed, as most characters in common
words alternate hands in Colemak, meaning that my hands don't have to stretch in
difficult positions, but its also more difficult to time fast keystrokes.

I also purchased keycaps for my mechanical keyboard for Colemak, which was super
helpful for the steep learning curve.

Switching to a new layout also means I can relearn which fingers correspond to
which keys. Being so accustomed to QWERTY before, I typed smoothly, even though
finger placement wasn't necessarily ergonomic. Switching to Colemak, though,
allows for a retraining of finger to character correspondence.

As for whether or not I'd recommend this switch, I probably wouldn't unless you
really have nothing do do in your free time and/or enjoy making people tear their
hair out when they try to use your computer.
